I am in my fourth year of studies Computer Engineering (CE) at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), highly interested in various fields of Artificial Intelligence, especially in natural language processing (NLP), anomaly detection, deep learning, and machine learning. I did [some projects](https://github.com/mhmdsmdi) in these fields.

Currently, I am working on my bachelor's thesis about "fake news detection" in Persian under the supervision of [Prof. Momtazi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2345/Saeede%20Momtazi).
In this study, I am in charge of implementing a fake news detection system as a fact-checker for Persian news. With this aim, I implemented a tool for crawling and scrapping fake news from Persian news agencies' websites. Furthermore, we proposed two deep models based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for detecting fake news accurately.

Moreover, I am studying on detecting anomaly on graph data using deep models with an unsupervised approach. In this study, we use variational autoencoders (VAE) for learning the common patterns of data to discern abnormal data in the graph. Also, we use different graph embedding techniques in order to use both structural and attributes features. This research is going under the supervision of [Prof. AmirHaeri](https://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~haeri/).

Last summer I spent my summer internship at the [Brain Engineering Research Center](http://braineng.scs.ipm.ac.ir/) of the [Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](http://www.ipm.ac.ir/) as a researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Lashgari](http://www.ipm.ac.ir/personalinfo.jsp?PeopleCode=IP0400047). I worked with a group of developers and researchers who tried to implement a health care system. I had to implement a question recommendation system based on the semantic similarity of user questions.

In addition, I was in SOP Company since June 2017 as an Android developer and responsible for defining software requirements and preparing documentation.
