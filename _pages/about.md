I am a third-year bachelor student of Computer Engineering (CE) at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), interested in anomaly detection, natural language processing (NLP), deep learning and machine learning. I did [some projects](https://github.com/mhmdsmdi) in these fields.

Now I am doing research on anomaly detection using variational autoencoder (VAE) in graph's dataset, under the supervision of [Maryam AmirHaeri](https://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~haeri/).
In addition, I am an Android developer in SOP Company since June 2017 and responsible for defining software requirements and preparing documentation.
