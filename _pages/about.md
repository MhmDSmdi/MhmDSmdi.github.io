I am in my fourth year of studies Computer Engineering (CE) at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), interested in natural language processing (NLP), anomaly detection, deep learning and machine learning. I did [some projects](https://github.com/mhmdsmdi) in these fields.

Last summer I spent my summer internship at [Brain Engineering Research Center](http://braineng.scs.ipm.ac.ir/) of the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM) as a researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Lashgari](rezalashgari@ipm.ir). I worked with a group of developers and researchers who tried to implement a health care system. I had to implement a question recommendation system based on the semantic similarity of user questions.
Also, one years ago, I did a research on anomaly detection using variational autoencoder (VAE) in graph's dataset, under the supervision of [Prof. AmirHaeri](https://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~haeri/).
In addition, I am an Android developer in SOP Company since June 2017 and responsible for defining software requirements and preparing documentation.
