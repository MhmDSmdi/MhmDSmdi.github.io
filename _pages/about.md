I am in my fourth year of studies Computer Engineering (CE) at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), highly interested in various fields of Artificial Intelligence, especially in natural language processing (NLP), anomaly detection, deep learning, and machine learning. My projects related to these fields can be found in [my GitHub page](https://github.com/mhmdsmdi).

# Notable Research Experiences

* **Fake News Detection** <br/>
Currently, I am working on my bachelor's thesis about "fake news detection" in Persian under the supervision of [Prof. Momtazi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2345/Saeede%20Momtazi).
In this study, I am in charge of implementing a fake news detection system as a fact-checker for Persian news. With this aim, I proposed a 5-step procedure for crawling fake news, and implemented a scraper based on this procedure from Persian news agencies' websites. Furthermore, we proposed different models based on deep pre-trained contextualized models such as BERT, RoBERTa, XLM, Funnel Transformer, and GPT2 for detecting fake news accurately. Moreover, we proposed different architectures like Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Networks for detecting misinformation in social media, specifically in the COVID-19 pandemic.

* **Anomaly Detection in Attributed Graphs** <br/>
During this project, I worked on detecting anomaly on graph data using deep models with an unsupervised approach. We used variational autoencoders (VAE) for learning the common patterns of data to discern abnormal data in the graph. Also, we utilized different graph embedding techniques in order to extract valuable structural features besides attributes features. This research is going under the supervision of [Prof. AmirHaeri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=eqX0aK8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

* **Question Recommendation System** <br/>
Last summer I spent my summer internship at the [Brain Engineering Research Center](http://braineng.scs.ipm.ac.ir/) of the [Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM)](http://www.ipm.ac.ir/about.jsp) as a researcher under the supervision of [Prof. Lashgari](http://www.ipm.ac.ir/personalinfo.jsp?PeopleCode=IP0400047). I worked with a group of developers and researchers who tried to implement a health care system. I had to implement a question recommendation system based on the semantic similarity of user questions.
