Research and Work Experience
======
* **Fake News Detection System**, *Bachelor’s Thesis* (April 2020 - present) <br/>
  Implemented a Persian fake news detection system using state-of-the-art architectures such as BERT for sentence embedding and Convolutional neural
networks for text classification. Also, a Persian fake news crawler was developed for scraping fake news from Persian news agencies websites - Python

* **Anomaly Detection in Graph** (September 2020 - present) <br/>
  Research on anomaly detection on graph data using variational autoencoders
  (VAE). In this study, nodes of the graph were represented by features vectors
  extracted with different graph embedding algorithm, and our proposed model
  can detect abnormal nodes in the graph - Python <br/>
  * Under supervision of Prof. AmirHaeri
  
* **Question Recommendation System** (May 2019 - November 2019) <br/>
  * Research Intern at **IPM Brain Engineering Center** <br/>
  This was my first project in NLP during my undergraduate studies. The goal
  was to develop a recommendation system using common text similarity metrics
  and static word embedding methods for recommending medical questions in the
  realm of Ophthalmology - Python <br/>
  * Under supervision of Prof. Lashgari
  
* SOP Company, as an Android Developer (October 2018 - October 2019) <br/>
  * Responsible for designing and developing a mHealth (mobile health) application
    and defining software requirements.
  
* Papillon Company, as Android Developer Intern (June 2017 - August 2017)

Notable Projects
======

* **Information Retrieval** <br/>
  A news search engine with the capability of crawling news, boolean searching,
  and vector space searching was developed. Clustering and classification algorithms were used for enhancing the search results and the speed of the search
  engine - Python
* **Data Mining** <br/>
  Implemented famous kaggle challenges about regression and classification: <br/>
  * Quora Insincere Questions Classification: Detecting toxic content to improve online conversations. <br/>
  * Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster: Createing a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. <br/>
  Also, various clustering problems solved by Kmeans and DBSCAN algorithms and using Elbow for determining the optimum parameters - Python
* **Principles of Computational Intelligence** <br/>
  Implemented an RBF neural network which trained by ES (Evolutionary Strategy) algorithm instead of backpropagation to update the weights and it used to
  solve regression and classification problems - Python
* **Principles and Applications of Artificial Intelligence** <br/>
  Implemented an interactive video based on foreground and background subtraction using MOG2 and KNN algorithms - Python
* **Algorithm Design** <br/>
  Detecting community structures using label propagation with weighted coherent
  neighborhood propinquity - Java
